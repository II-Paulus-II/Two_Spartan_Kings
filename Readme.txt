Ever wanted to play as Sparta with two kings instead of one? Well now you can! 

This mod adds:

1. Adds a Co-Basileus to the monarchy in Sparta so that it is now a true diarchy.
2. Succession is not shown in tooltips before the co-Basileus dies. This is because succession is scripted upon death.
3. Co-Basileus is very loyal to the state as he is effectively equal to the Basileus.
4. Spartan Heritage is changed so that the negative aspect of the heritage reduces slave happiness instead of output
5. Basic Spartan Diarchy has one religious idea to differentiate it a little more from the vanilla "stratocratic" monarchy.
6. Can arrange marriage for all members of the ruling families. 

Bug Fixes for vanilla included in this mod:

1. Primary heirs that belong to the same family as the ruler will now always get the appropriate gold and holdings from the former king. 
2. Wealthy children that die will no longer give more money than they had to those who would inherit.


Notes on Mod Compatibility:

This mod modifies the Government GUI file and as such is incompatible with any mod which modifies this file. Agamidae's Better UI can be loaded before this mod in the loader and as such you will be able to use both mods, however, the changes that Agamidae made to the government GUI that give extra loyalty information will not be present for you. 

This mod will also not be compatible with anything that touches government types for example, giving a government type more ideas. 

Further, the setup file 00_default.txt has to be changed so that the spartans can have the Eurypontid family and setting the government type to the appropriate form of government with the coruler. This means that any mod that touches this setup file will be incompatible - this includes shattered world type mods and even the mod bloodlines which is in a similar situation. 

If you run into any problems please feel free to leave a message and one of us will get back to you.  

Enjoy!
