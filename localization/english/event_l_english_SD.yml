###EVENT 2: Spartan Flavour Event to start the game off
 spartan_event.2.t:0 "Alexander the Terrible"
 spartan_event.2.desc:0 "Babylon, 18 years ago, King Alexander died suddenly at the age of 32, shattering his newly conquered empire. Since his father, King Philip, the Macedonians have risen to become the hegemon of all the Greeks, except us Spartans. This defiance has never been forgotten by the Macedonians, and Alexander the "Great" humiliated us diplomatically, and later militarily, at the battle of Megalopolis. We remain independent, but the gods have mocked us with their twisted sense of humour.\n\nThe loss of Messene and the Helots shows the Greek world that our own house is not in order, thus our Spartan heritage is slowly losing it's credibility. Most Greeks will rememeber our absence in the Persian campaign, and our failed campaign against the Macedonians. However, as the Diadochi are focused on internal wars among themselves, we have a small window of opportunity to reform, adapt and restore the old order. \n\nSon's of Heracles, through Hades we will rise!"
 spartan_event.2.a:0 "Molon Labe!"
###EVENT 3: New Spartan Ruler Flavour Event
 spartan_event.3.t:0 "The Basileus is dead"
 spartan_event.3.desc:0 "Sad news this morning, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [SCOPE.sChar('old_spartan_king').GetPraenomen] of the [SCOPE.sChar('old_spartan_king').GetFamilyDisplayName] family has crossed the river Styx. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCoRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName] family received the news and have joined the [SCOPE.sChar('old_spartan_king').GetFamilyDisplayName] family in their last farewell. As the city of Sparta falls silent in mourning this day, the next day will mark a new beginning, a new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], and together with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCoRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName]'s Sparta will continue it's Heraclian legacy."
 spartan_event.3.a:0 "Tonight he dines in Hades."
###EVENT 4: New Spartan Ruler Flavour Event - If co-ruler was the primary heir
 spartan_event.4.t:0 "The Royal Eclipse"
 spartan_event.4.desc:0 "As rare as a visit from one of the god's, the perception of who is the dominant of the two royal families has changed. Though they are equals, sharing Heraclian blood, the [SCOPE.sChar('old_ruler').GetFamilyDisplayName]'s have been seen, traditionally, as the slightly more prominent of the two. This is a result of the family's legacy, famous characters and heroes of old. However this has changed, people's perception of what family is the more prominent has been turned upside down, and this is a slow but long expected change as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName]'s have raised many great leaders and heroes of late, effectively eclipsing the other family."
 spartan_event.4.a:0 "First among equals!"
###EVENT 5: New Spartan Co-Ruler Flavour Event
 spartan_event.5.t:0 "The Co-Basileus is dead"
 spartan_event.5.desc:0 "Sad news this morning, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCoRulerTitle] [SCOPE.sChar('old_co_ruler').GetPraenomen] of the [SCOPE.sChar('old_co_ruler').GetFamilyDisplayName] Family has gone to Hades. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName]'s recieved the news and joined the [SCOPE.sChar('old_co_ruler').GetFamilyDisplayName] family to pay their last respects. On this day the city of Sparta remained quiet, mourning their late [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCoRulerTitle], but as the sun rises, a new day and a new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCoRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCoRulerTitle] rises to the throne. Together with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayName] family they will lead Sparta forward, and continue it's Heraclian legacy."
